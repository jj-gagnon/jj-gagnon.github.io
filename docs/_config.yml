# These are used to personalize your new site. If you look in the HTML files,

    JJ Gagnon is a British Columbia born multimedia artist residing in Montreal. His key inspiration is in finding synergies between form and content in new or divergent forms of media. Themes such as minimalism, symmetry, surreality, and the uncanny familiar extend throughout his work.
    His skills range widely and include photography, sculpture, generative art, painting, videography, projection and reflection, and interactive media.
