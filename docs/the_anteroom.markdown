# The Anteroom

This is where we wait now, with clarity fueled by anxiety trapped and bouncing in our heads, alone and unqueued. We wait for the diagnosis, the letter, the results, and judgment that can come at any hour day or night. Given the time and space of the modern anteroom what else is there to do but to take a pause and look around.

These four large inkjet prints present an impression of the inner mind situated in a technological society where “news” is at our fingertips in a notification and the waiting room is now our living room.
